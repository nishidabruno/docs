### What is an Image Block?

An **Image Block** is used to generate or display images in your canvas.\
It can receive inputs from other blocks (such as **Text Blocks** or **Reference Blocks**) and transform them into images powered by AI models.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/image-block.png)
</Frame>

### Creating an Image Block

To create a new Image Block:

1. **Right-click** anywhere on the canvas.
2. From the menu, select **Image**.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/create-image-block.png)
</Frame>

### How it works

- Connect the Image Block to an another **Image Block** or **Text Block** to supply the image description.
- The AI model processes the input and generates an image.
- You can preview the generated result directly inside the block.
- Image outputs can be connected to other blocks for further editing or composition.

### Example use cases

- Generating concept art from text prompts.
- Creating product mockups or visual drafts.
- Iterating on design ideas by connecting multiple Text or Prompt Blocks to the same Image Block.
