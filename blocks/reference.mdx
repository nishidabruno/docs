### What is a Reference Block?

A **Reference Block** lets you upload and use an image as a visual reference in your draft.  
This is especially useful for guiding AI image generation, providing style inspiration, or ensuring consistency across multiple outputs.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/reference-block.png" />
</Frame>

### Creating a Reference Block

To create a new Reference Block:  
1. **Drag and drop** an image file onto the canvas.  
2. The file will automatically be added as a **Reference Block**.  

> ⚠️ Images must be **under 5MB** in size.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/create-reference-block.png" />
</Frame>

### How it works

- Once added, the image is displayed directly in the block.  
- You can connect the Reference Block to **Image Blocks** to guide the generation process.  
- Multiple Reference Blocks can be used in the same draft to combine different styles or examples.  

### Example use cases

- Using a photo as a style or composition guide.  
- Uploading brand assets (logos, icons, mockups) for consistency.  
- Providing multiple references to influence an AI-generated image.
