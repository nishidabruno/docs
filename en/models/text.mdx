### What are Text Models?

**Text Models** are AI engines specialized in generating, refining, or transforming text.\
They are typically used to create prompts for images, expand ideas, or provide descriptive content for creative projects.

Currently, Canvasit supports the following text models:

| Model           | Est. Time per Request | Credit Cost | Best Use Case                              |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GPT-4.1 Nano    | ~1–2 seconds        | 1        | Quick prompts, short text, fast results    |
| GPT-4o Mini     | ~1–2 seconds        | 1     | General prompts, medium-length text, flexible use |

### How to Use Text Models

Create a **Text Block**, then choose the desired model from the menu.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/select-text-model.png" />
</Frame>

- Use the output from the text model as input for an **Image Block** or another AI block.
- Experiment with different models depending on your needs: speed vs. quality vs. cost.
